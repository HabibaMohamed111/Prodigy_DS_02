# Titanic Dataset Analysis

# Task 2 included:

Performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. I explored relationships between variables and identified patterns and trends in the data.

# Key takeaways and skills I developed during this task:

✅Data cleaning and preprocessing:

➡ I learned how to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset to ensure accurate and reliable analysis.

✅Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

 ➡I gained hands-on experience in performing EDA, identifying key variables, and understanding their distributions. This step was crucial in uncovering hidden patterns in the dataset.

✅Analyzing relationships between variables: 

➡By exploring correlations and interactions between features like age, gender, class, and survival rate, I could identify key factors that influenced passenger survival.

✅Visualizing insights: 

➡I utilized Python libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn to create visualizations like heatmaps, bar charts, and box plots. These visual aids helped to better understand relationships and trends within the data.

# Tools :
